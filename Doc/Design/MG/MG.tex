\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview}
The ReTouch project is a re-implementation of the open source project K-Touch which allows users to track their speed and accuracy in typing, and results in improved typing skills through practice and repetition.

\subsection{Context}
The Module Guide document is created after the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. The purpose of this is to allow the project design to be based off a set structure of functional and non-functional requirements that are featured in the SRS. Therefore, this MG document is used to provide a modular decomposition of the system, and by following the SRS, all the featured modules and the system is ensured to meet the functional and non-functional requirements. Additionally, the Module Interface Specification (MIS) is created after the MG document which provides further detail on all the modules specified in the MG document. The MIS specifies the externally observable behavior and explains the semantics and syntax of the functions for each module in the system.

\subsection{Design Principles}

The Design Principles being used to guide the decomposition of the system into modules include Information Hiding which supports design for change, and the criteria that the modules have low coupling and high cohesion. The principle of Information Hiding allows for all expected changes to be identified and encapsulates each expected change. In other words, each modules secrets are hidden from the rest of the system and the module design interface will not change even if a a module's secret changes. Additionally, low-coupling would mean that the modules are independent and do not use one another. High cohesion within the modules would indicate that the elements of the module are strongly related. 

\subsection{Document Structure}

This Module Guide document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific hardware on which the software is running.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format of the initial input data.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The Operating Systems of which the Software interfaces with.
 \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format of the final output and display.
 \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The graphical user interface elements used to display effects of user input.
 \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The calculation methods for determining user speed and accuracy.
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The number of lessons (and their contents) that can be selected by the user.
   \item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The precision of the timer and whether it should measure milliseconds.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] There will always be a source of input data external to the software.
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The goal/purpose of the system: To assist users in enhancing their typing abilities by tracking their speed and accuracy when completing lessons. 
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucInput}:] The methods and functions used to track whether inputted characters match the expected characters. 
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\begin{description}
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Hardware-Hiding Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Display Characters Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Lesson Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Parser Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Selection Page Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] User Input Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Make Results Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Results Module
\item [\refstepcounter{mnum} \mthemnum \label{mHH}:] Scheduler Module

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table \ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  Also indicate if the
module will be implemented specifically for the software.

Only the leaf modules in the
hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash (\emph{--}) is shown, this means
that the module is not a leaf and will not have to be implemented. Whether or
not this module is implemented depends on the programming language
selected.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{mHH})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The data structure and algorithm used to implement the virtual
  hardware.
\item[Services:]Serves as a virtual hardware used by the rest of the
  system. This module provides the interface between the hardware and the
  software. So, the system can use it to display outputs or to accept inputs.
\item[Implemented By:] OS
\end{description}

\subsection{Behaviour-Hiding Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The contents of the required behaviours.
\item[Services:]Includes programs that provide externally visible behaviour of
  the system as specified in the software requirements specification (SRS)
  documents. This module serves as a communication layer between the
  hardware-hiding module and the software decision module. The programs in this
  module will need to change if there are changes in the SRS.
\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Input Format Module (\mref{mInput})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The format and structure of the input data.
\item[Services:]Converts the input data into the data structure used by the
  input parameters module.
\item[Implemented By:] [Your Program Name Here]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}


\subsection{Software Decision Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The design decision based on mathematical theorems, physical
  facts, or programming considerations. The secrets of this module are
  \emph{not} described in the SRS.
\item[Services:] Includes data structure and algorithms used in the system that
  do not provide direct interaction with the user. 
  % Changes in these modules are more likely to be motivated by a desire to
  % improve performance than by externally imposed changes.
\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.
