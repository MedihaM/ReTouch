%\section{What problem are you trying to solve?}

In a world so dependent on and advanced by technology, it has became a requirement for individuals to be proficient with a computer. This includes being able to perform many tasks such as writing up documents, recording data and communicating through virtual methods. In order to complete all these tasks efficiently, people in a variety of fields are expected to be able to type quickly and accurately. Therefore, the goal for this project is to develop an application that will assist users in improving their typing skills and allow them to become more proficient with computer usage. 
\\
%\section{Why is this an important problem?}

Improving typing speed and accuracy is very important for several reasons. To begin, the average employer expects their employees to have basic computer skills, including typing. Furthermore, individuals more often than not are expected to have at minimum average typing skills. In addition, learning to type quickly and accurately saves time and consequently saves money. Also, a large focus in today's world is improving proficiency at work and at home, and learning to type better is one very easy solution to this. Lastly, by becoming proficient at typing, individuals may have an advantage over other candidates when applying for jobs and, therefore, may open up more opportunities for themselves.
\\
%\section{What is the context of the problem you are solving?}

%\subsection{Who are the stakeholders?}

The stakeholders for this application include the current developers (Group 7) and any future developers who may contribute to the project. The software clients are Dr.Bokhari and the course TA's. Lastly, the final stakeholders are all of the potential ReTouch users who are looking to improve their typing speed and accuracy. 
\\
%\subsection{What is the environment for the software?}

KTouch is an open-source software that is meant to assist individuals in improving their typing skills. It is currently only available on Linux operating systems. This project is meant to re-implement and improve KTouch into an application called ReTouch. The scope of ReTouch will be to improve KTouch by making it available on other operating systems while improving much of the functionality and user experience. ReTouch's functionalities will be very beneficial to classrooms and other educational institutions, as well as to anyone else seeking to independently improve their typing skills.
